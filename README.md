A toy car that can move and turn electronically 

# Arduino-Controlled Car Project

This repository contains the source code for an Arduino-controlled car that uses two servo motors to navigate. The car can move forward, turn left, turn right, and stop.

## Features

- **Forward Movement**: The car moves forward for specified intervals.
- **Turning**: The car can perform left and right turns.
- **Stop Function**: Ability to stop the car using software control.

## Hardware Required

- Arduino Nano
- 2 x Servo Motors
- Jumper Wires
- Breadboard (optional for prototyping)
- Power Source (e.g., 9V battery)
- Tamiya - Track & Wheel Set

## Software Dependencies

- Arduino IDE (Download [here](https://www.arduino.cc/en/software))
- AVR Compiler

## Setup

1. **Assemble Hardware**: Connect the servo motors to the Arduino Nano as follows:
   - Left Servo Motor to Pin 3
   - Right Servo Motor to Pin 2
2. **Power Setup**: Connect your 9V battery to the VIN and GND on the Arduino for power.
